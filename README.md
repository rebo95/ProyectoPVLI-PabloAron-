# ProyectoPVLI-PabloAron-
PVLI-UCM version of the NES game Gradius. We will take the original mechcanics and we will create our own game. 
We wanto to keep the original gameplay adding new features like new shooting modes and enemyes with new behaviours and apareace.
It will be one level game with a end stage , in wich you will have to face a final boss, different from the bosses of the original game.

Project Gradius:
A single player experience that will make you
revive the original one, but adjusting the level 
for nowadays casual players.
Almost the same experience , but not particular 
for hardcore gamers.
We hope you will enjoy it.
